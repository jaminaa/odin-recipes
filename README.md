This webpage will display recipes for making simple down-to-earth food. While making I learned how to:
1. Use the terminal for moving image files and creating htmls and directories
2. Structure simple websites(keeping images and htmls seperate)
3. Commit projects to github and write meaningful messages
Overall, this project was pretty simple however adding git commit messages took most of the time. Can't wait to create more complex sites
